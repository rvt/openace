> [!TIP]
> Please visit the [GA/TAS WIKI](https://rvt.github.io/gatas-doc/) for build information.

The GA/TAS Conspicuity device is designed for General Aviation pilots flying in areas where multiple
protocols, such as OGN, Flarm, ADS-L and FANET, are used. It can transmit and receive multiple
protocols simultaneously (excluding sending ADS-B) using one or more transceiver modules. All
received traffic is sent to your Electronic Flight Bag (EFB), such as SkyDemon, via the GDL90
protocol via WIFI or NMEA via bluetooth or WIFI.

The device is built around the Raspberry RP2040/RP2350 and can be configured with a custom PCB that
supports either two transceivers or a simpler configuration with one with modules from Waveshare
which makes it more of a plug-and-play. In both setups, it can send and receive all protocols using
time-sharing technology. The device can store configurations for multiple aircraft, which can be
selected through an easy-to-use web interface or via gatasServer

Powered by a Li-Ion battery, the device includes a PCB with a USB-C charger. The estimated battery
life is between 6 and 10 hours, though this is subject to further testing.

For FLARM it's current range has been t ested up to 24Km (see below screenshots) but on average a
good 15Km can be expected. This will give you plenty of time to avoid the traffic. EFBs like
SkyDemon can also send out audible traffic warnings.

Note: Although it's primary design is based around GA traffic, there is nothing in the hardware to
prevent other use cases like gliders, paragliders and hang gliders. The goal of the project is to be
seen by transmitting different protocols and be able to see them.

## Radio Protocol Support

Radio Protocol is the method used to communicate with other conspicuity devices

| Radio Protocol.        | Send               | Receive            | Multi Protocol     |
|------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| OGN                    | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| ADS-L                  | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| FLARM (2024)           | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| FANET                  | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| ADS-B with Module.     | :no_entry:         | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_minus_sign: |
| ADS-B via gatasConnect | :no_entry:         | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_minus_sign: |
| PAW                    | :construction:     | :construction:     | :construction:     |

\* Multi Protocol is a feature of GA/TAS that allows to enable multiple protocols both send and
receive on a single transceiver by sharing the air time. The Transceiver will alternate between the
different protocols and prioritize a specific protocol when it receives data for that protocol.

- Fanet support sending and receving including forwaring of FANET messages
- gatasConnect is a protocol and service to receive additional traffic information via mobile
  connection.

### Communication support

Communication support is what protocols are supported to other devices like electronic flight bags
or other equipment.

| Protocol     | Send UDP over WIFI | Receive UDP over WIFI | Send Bluetooth     | Send TCP over WIFI | Receiver over TCP WIFI |
|--------------|--------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| GDL90        | :heavy_check_mark: | N/A                   | N/A                | N/A                | N/A                    |
| AirConnect   | N/A                | N/A                   | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | N/A                    |
| Dump1090     | N/A                | N/A                   | N/A                | N/A                | :heavy_check_mark:     |
| gatasConnect | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:    | N/A                | N/A                | :heavy_check_mark:     |

\* Sending GDL90 over Bluetooth is not used in the industry so this is currently not setup. If this
is really required, then this can be done. Do let me know the use case

### Tested with Electronic Flight Bag

GA/TAS is currently tested with SkyDemon only, If you made it work with any other software on Phone
or Tablet, do let me know so I can add or help out to make this work.

## gatasConnect & gatasServer

**gatasConnect** and **gatasServer** provide a lightweight UDP-based protocol for receiving
additional traffic information.
This is still somewhat experimental but up an running and usable, it's free for you to use on the pre-configured server. Just enable
'gatasConnect' and ensure GA/TAS does have internet access via your mobile dev ice. Configure **Client** mode to connect to
your mobile's access point, how cool is that!

> [!TIP]
> gatasConnect uses [https://airplanes.live](https://airplanes.live) to to deliver internet-based traffic to your GA/TAS
> and into your EFB, including ADS-B Out and MLAT-derived traffic.
> If you have the chance, please consider adding airplanes.live to your existing feed or creating a new one.
> By doing so, you help improve traffic coverage for yourself and for others and contribute to safer flying.
>

## Features

- Online web application to select your configured aircraft
- Eliminates the need to manually connect to GA/TAS vi WIFI to choose an aircraft, saves time and
  you can focus on flying.
- Still compatible with GA/TAS aircraft selection via **gatas build in web service**
- Future support for **automatic aircraft selection** based on correlated ADS-B traffic

### Network Usage

- **Transmit:** ~52 bytes/second
- **Receive:** ~1024 bytes/second at 30 aircraft. (supports up to 30 nearby aircraft)
