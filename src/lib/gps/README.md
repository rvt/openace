# Adding Support for a New GPS Type

When integrating a new type of GPS receiver, there are two key requirements to ensure proper functionality:

- **Update Rate**:  
  The GPS must provide a consistent update rate of 2 Hz (2 updates per second). This is currently a fixed expectation within the system due to filtering mechanisms that depend on this rate.

- **Data Format**:  
  The NMEA GGA sentence must report altitude relative to the **WGS84 datum above GEOID**, and include the **geoid separation** field. Accurate vertical positioning relies on this information.

### Additional Notes

While any GNSS constellation is technically supported, it is **recommended** to use receivers that support **GPS and Galileo**, with **SBAS/WAAS** enabled for enhanced accuracy and reliability.

## Static GPS

`StaticGPS` is a disabled-by-default, hardware-free `AbstractGnss` implementation. It reads decimal latitude, longitude, altitude above mean sea level, and an NTP server from configuration. Its own FreeRTOS software timer wakes a dedicated task every 500 ms; the task publishes checksum-valid GLL, RMC, GGA, GSA, and two GSV sentences for a stationary aircraft tracking north.

The generated GGA sentence carries the configured mean-sea-level altitude and derives geoid separation from GATAS's embedded EGM2008 lookup. GGA is required by `GpsDecoder` alongside RMC. GSA reports a 3D fix so the rest of the firmware receives normal GPS-fix status. The module waits for valid epoch time, synchronizes from its configured NTP server after Wi-Fi client connectivity, routes the received fractional-second phase through `RtcModule::ppsEvent()`, retries failed requests, and re-disciplines the software PPS every five minutes.
